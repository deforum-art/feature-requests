# Why here?

Huemin has attempted to get us brainstorming about this on discord for [months](https://discordapp.com/channels/1010951174146510939/1063895338345304064/1063895845709283478) and although everyone is excited by the idea and open to discussion, I think the chat format of discord might be a bit too unstructured for this sort of thing. 

The purpose of this repository is just to use the "discussions" tab as a mechanism for proposing, discussing, and prioritizing potential features.

Please visit the [**discussions**](https://github.com/deforum-art/feature-requests/discussions) page and join the conversation!
