# Forum for developer discussion and triaging of future features and design

This is a space for deforum developers to collaboratively plan the next generation of AI tooling.

**This space is NOT for users to request features for the current deforum.** This is explicitly for planning and prioritizing what we want the next thing to look like. To request new features for current generation tooling, please visit the [Deforum Discord](https://discord.com/invite/deforum).

* [**Suggest a feature**](https://github.com/deforum-art/feature-requests/discussions/new?category=ideas): create a new discusion under the "ideas" category
* [**Suggest a discussion topic**](https://github.com/deforum-art/feature-requests/discussions/new?category=general): create a new discussion under the "general" category

# Why here?

Huemin has attempted to get us brainstorming about this on discord for [months](https://discordapp.com/channels/1010951174146510939/1063895338345304064/1063895845709283478) and although everyone is excited by the idea and open to discussion, I think the chat format of discord might be a bit too unstructured for this sort of thing. 

The purpose of this repository is just to use the "discussions" tab as a mechanism for proposing, discussing, and prioritizing potential features.

Please visit the [**discussions**](https://github.com/deforum-art/feature-requests/discussions) page and join the conversation!
